    Solves CAPTCHA challenges using various methods.

    Available methods to bypass CAPTCHA:

    1. **2Captcha API**: 
       - Use the paid 2Captcha service to send the CAPTCHA challenge to their servers.
       - The service will solve the CAPTCHA and return the solution.
       - Requires an API key and the site key of the CAPTCHA.

    2. **Anti-Captcha API**: 
       - Similar to 2Captcha, this service allows you to send CAPTCHA challenges for solving.
       - It supports various types of CAPTCHAs, including reCAPTCHA and hCaptcha.
       - Requires an API key and site key.

    3. **Manual Solving**: 
       - Prompt the user to solve the CAPTCHA manually.
       - This can be done by displaying the CAPTCHA image and asking the user to input the solution.

    4. **Browser Automation**: 
       - Use browser automation tools (like Selenium) to interact with the CAPTCHA directly.
       - This method may involve simulating human behavior to bypass simple CAPTCHAs.

    5. **Machine Learning Models**: 
       - Train a machine learning model to recognize and solve CAPTCHAs.
       - This method requires a significant amount of data and may not be effective against advanced CAPTCHAs.
